When i was on my way to 

### The Beginner Path

- 0. Machine learning concepts — understand what kind of problems machine learning can and should be used for. [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) is great for this.

- 1.  [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) For Web Development skills

- 2. [cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/)  and cs50 artificial intelligence on Youtube for foundational computer science and artificial intelligence skills.

- 3. ["What I learned from looking at 200 machine learning tools"](https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html) 

- 4. [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

- 5. [This is fast.ai making neural nets uncool again](https://www.fast.ai/)

- 6 [Any of deeplearning.ai’s curriculum(s)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) — choose the one which sparks your interest the most. Compliments fast.ai’s practical approach with theory.

- 7. [Full-stack deep learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) This is where i am going to tie together machine learning knowledge i've got with the wev development knowledge i've been learning.
