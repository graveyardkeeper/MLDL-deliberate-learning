I got an idea to a make nice and clean repository for learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning when i've done reading this BLog ["How I'd start learning machinnne learning again in 3 years](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-id-start-learning-machine-learning-again-3-years-in-55c52aaee52a) by Daniel Bourke.


-  Machine learning concepts — understand what kind of problems machine learning can and should be used for. [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) is great for this.

-  [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) For Web Development skills

-  [cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/)  and cs50 artificial intelligence on Youtube for foundational computer science and artificial intelligence skills.

- ["What I learned from looking at 200 machine learning tools"](https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html)  This Blog itself has loads of resources in it.

- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

- [This is fast.ai making neural nets uncool again](https://www.fast.ai/)

- [Any of deeplearning.ai’s curriculum(s)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) — choose the one which sparks your interest the most. Compliments fast.ai’s practical approach with theory.

- [Full-stack deep learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) This is where i am going to tie together machine learning knowledge i've got with the wev development knowledge i've been learning.
